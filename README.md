# RestAPIs-MongoDB-Express-Postman
In this PoC project I have tried to build rest API for GET,POST,PUT,DELETE operations using Express Server. Mongo DB is used to store the data created in the process.Postman is used to send the different types of request(CRUD) to the server and verify the response received.
